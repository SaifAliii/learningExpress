Express:
	1.	Why to use Express instead of Node:
		1.	Provides Readability
		2.	Less Code
		3. 	Middle Ware
	2.	To Get use app.get(location, callback function having two parameters 1 is request other is responce)
			To send data to a browser use response.send(something)
				something can be plain text like "Hello" or html like "<h1>Hello</h1>"
			To send file to a browser use response.sendFile(filepath)
				while specifying file path always use __dirname(2underscores then dirname), it will give
				the current path of the directory like sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html")			
	3.	To get data of file on server side you need a package name body parser so intsall it
		using command npm i body-parser
			it works with express and have several modes
			you can use it as app.use(mode)
				mode1.	bodyParser.text
				mode2.	bodyParser.json
				mode3.	bodyParser.urlencoded --> to parse data that comes from an html page 
					you can use option extended: true like app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))
	4.	to perform calculations on data from html page use app.post(location, callback function(same as GET))
			req.body will give you all the data from the html page and you can access them by dot notation
				req.body.variableName (by default it is text)
				to type cast it in number use Number(req.body.var)
	5.	The problem is that you have to restart server every time you change something
			The solution is install nodemon using command "npm install -g nodemon"
